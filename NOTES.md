# 🍅 1: Jumpstart the kata and guards

# Atomic behaviours

### Does a row contain all numbers 1-9?

- [5,3,4,6,7,8,9,1,2] -> true 😊
- [5,3,4,6,3,8,9,1,2] -> false 😊
- [5,3,4,6,'A',8,9,1,2] -> false

## Guards

- Input is a valid sudoku grid, ie 9 rows with 9 entries each. 😊
- All entries are numbers 1-9 😊

# 🍅 2: implement function

# 🍅 3: New tests

## Does a row contains 9 entries

- [1,2,3,4,5] -> false 😊
- [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8] -> true 😊
- [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9] -> false 😊

# 🍅 4: Decreasing tech debt and check if a row is a valid sudoku row

## Check if the input grid is 9x9
